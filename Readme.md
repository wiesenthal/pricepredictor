a neural network to predict the price of ethereum. 

Trained on data from coinmetrics.io

It does the entire training and output process several times then takes the average, in an attempt to more consistent results.
Surprisingly the average isn't usually simply yesterday's price.

run.bat runs the program with default parameters.

Use "python neuralnetwork.py -h" for help
